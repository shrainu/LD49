# LD49
 A game made for Ludum Dare #49 in C# using Raylib.

 Game is a rogue-like dungeon crawler, which takes place in a strange environment 
 where everything literally everything mutates. There is absolutely nothing stable
 about this game. Each time you go deeper and deeper everything gets weirder and
 weirder, teleporting walls? friendly enemies? hostile floors? You name it, get
 ready for an **UNSTABLE** experience.
